# Detection of Musical Figures on 2D with MASK - RCNN

Juan Monta√±ez - Arnold Herrera

This project is focused in the detection of musical figures on 2D images using Deep Learning Methods like MASK - RCNN

For this project is necessary:

- CUDA 			= 10.1
- CUDNN 			= cudnn-10.1-windows10-x64-v7.5.0.56
- PYTHON 			= Python 3.7
- Tensorflow		= 2.3.0
- Tensorflow-gpu 	= 2.3.0
##Configuration

To configurate the environment is necessary download the follow files:
- https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/ 
- https://github.com/tensorflow/models

The protobuf will use to compile the proto files localted in the folder models/research/object detection/protos, that allow train the model.
